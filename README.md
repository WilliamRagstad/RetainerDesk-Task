# RetainerDesk Task
Below are instructions on how to run the implementation for the task in each different language.

## C#
This is a Visual Studio project, which means that the IDE must be installed.
Core program is in `C#\CSTask\Program.cs`.

## Elixir
This implementation is written as an Elixir script, which means that Elixir must be installed.
Run using `elixir Elixir\task.exs`.

## Java
This is a small java project written using Eclipse. It is using an external Java library for processing JSON objects and arrays.
Core program is in `Java\Task.java`

## Node.js
This is one of the smaller (and prettiest) implementations of the task, which is using the Node.js runtime. Meaning that the HTTP response can be natively parsed to a JavaScript object.
To support the fetch function, I added the `node-fetch` npm package.
Run using `node Node.js\index.js`

## PowerShell
This is the smallest implementation of this task, it is only one line with 110 characters.
If you are running Windows, run using the provided `task.bat` file, or through the terminal `powershell .\PowerShell\task.ps1`.

# Why five languages?
Because I had too much spare-time during the weekend and saw this as a fun challenge!
